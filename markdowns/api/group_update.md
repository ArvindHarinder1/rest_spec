```
### Optional request headers

|:-----------|:------|:----------|
| X-Sample-Header  | string  | Sample HTTP header. Update accordingly or remove if not needed|

### Request body
In the request body, supply the values for relevant fields that should be updated. Existing properties that are not included in the request body will maintain their previous values or be recalculated based on changes to other property values. For best performance you shouldn't include existing values that haven't changed.

| Property	   | Type	|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|accessType|groupAccessType||
|allowExternalSenders|boolean||
|autoSubscribeNewMembers|boolean||

|isFavorite|boolean||
|isSubscribedByMail|boolean||
|mail|string|The SMTP address for the group, for example, "serviceadmins@contoso.onmicrosoft.com".|
|mailEnabled|boolean|Specifies whether the group is mail-enabled. If the **securityEnabled** property is also **true**, the group is a mail-enabled security group; otherwise, the group is a Microsoft Exchange distribution group. Only (pure) security groups can be created using Azure AD Graph. For this reason, the property must be set **false** when creating a group and it cannot be updated using Azure AD Graph.|

|onPremisesLastSyncDateTime|dateTimeOffset||
|onPremisesSecurityIdentifier|string|Contains the on-premises security identifier (SID) for the group that was synchronized from on-premises to the cloud.                            **Notes**: Requires version 1.5 or newer.            |
|onPremisesSyncEnabled|boolean||
|proxyAddresses|string|                                        **Notes**: not nullable, the **any** operator is required for filter expressions on multi-valued properties; for more information, see [Supported Queries, Filters, and Paging Options](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn727074.aspx).            |
|securityEnabled|boolean|Specifies whether the group is a security group. If the mailEnabled property is also true, the group is a mail-enabled security group; otherwise it is a security group. Only (pure) security groups can be created using Azure AD Graph. For this reason, the property must be set **true** when creating a group.|
